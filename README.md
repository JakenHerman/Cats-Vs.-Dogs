**Gameplay**




Points are calculated by reaching the farthest possible distance in an ever-continuing run. The farther you make it in the course, the higher your score.

Cats will have to run from common enemies like the pound, dogs, and Crazy Cat Ladies. Occasionally, they will have to avoid obstacles such as jumping over puddles in the ground, and ducking below oncoming traffic. They will have 3 power-ups:

1.	The “Red Laser” power-up  – This will grant them the ability to automatically avoid obstacles due to their high focus on catching the red laser for a total of 10 seconds.
2.	The “Catnip” power-up – This will grant cats the ability of super-speed and super strength for 10 seconds. By super strength, that means the cat will be able to hit one enemy without having any damage done to them. Obstacles will still result in a loss.
3.	The “Not-So-Fancy Feast” power-up – This will grant cats the ability to avoid Crazy Cat Ladies for the rest of the game. This is the more rare power-up of the three, and will not be given generously.
	

Dogs will also have to run from common enemies, such as the pounds, cats, and vacuum cleaners. They will have the same obstacles as cats do. They will also have 3 power-ups:

1.	The “Who’s A Good Boy?” power-up – This will grant dogs the satisfaction of finally finding out who this mysterious ‘good boy’ is. Being so happy about the fact that it is them, they will be able to automatically avoid obstacles due to their high sense of pride.
2.	The “Fetch” power-up – This will grant dogs ability of super-speed and super strength for 10 seconds. By super strength, that means the dog will be able to hit one enemy without having any damage done to them. Obstacles will still result in a loss.
3.	The “Collar” power-up – This will grant dogs the ability to avoid being taken to the pound for the rest of the game. This is the more rare power-up of the three, and will not be given generously.
